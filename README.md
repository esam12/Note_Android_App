📝 NoteApp - A Simple Notes Application

Welcome to NoteApp, a minimalist notes application built with Kotlin and leveraging modern Android development tools. This project demonstrates the principles of Clean Architecture, integrating Jetpack Compose for UI, Room Database for local storage, and Dagger Hilt for dependency injection. The app ensures modularity, scalability, and testability.

│   ├── data_source    // Room database and DAO definitions
│   ├── repository     // Implementation of repository interfaces
├── domain
│   ├── model          // Entity models for domain logic
│   ├── repository     // Abstract repository interfaces
│   ├── use_case       // Business logic encapsulated in use cases
├── presentation
│   ├── notes          // Note screen UI and ViewModel
│   ├── Main           // App Main Screen
├── di                 // Dependency injection modules
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Prerequisites
- Android Studio: Latest version with Kotlin support.
- JDK 17: Required for the Android Gradle plugin.

Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```plaintext
git clone https://github.com/esam12/Note_Android_App.git
```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Sync the Gradle files and resolve dependencies.

4. Run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

## 💡 Application Flow

The application flow is as follows:

1. **User Interaction**:
    - The user can add, edit, or delete notes.
    - Notes are displayed in a list with proper UI components built using Jetpack Compose.

2. **Data Handling**:
    - User actions interact with the **ViewModel**, which handles the business logic through `Use Cases`.
    - `Use Cases` fetch or manipulate data using the **Repository**.

3. **Database Operations**:
    - The `Room Database` manages the storage of notes locally.
    - DAO (`Data Access Objects`) is used for structured queries to interact with the database.

4. **Dependency Injection**:
    - `Dagger Hilt` is used for managing dependencies across the layers of the application.

5. **Architecture Flow**:
    - **Presentation Layer**: Contains UI and handles user interaction.
    - **Domain Layer**: Includes the business logic encapsulated in `Use Cases`.
    - **Data Layer**: Responsible for data storage and retrieval using Room and Repository implementation.

## ✨ Highlights

- **Clean Architecture**:
  - The project follows the **Clean Architecture** pattern to ensure a scalable and maintainable codebase.
  - The app is divided into **Presentation**, **Domain**, and **Data** layers, with clear responsibilities for each layer.

- **Jetpack Compose**:
  - Utilizes **Jetpack Compose** for building a modern, declarative, and responsive UI.
  - UI components are reusable, making the design consistent and modular.

- **Dagger Hilt**:
  - Implemented **Dagger Hilt** for efficient dependency injection across the app.
  - Simplifies managing dependencies in the **ViewModel**, **Use Cases**, and **Repository**.

- **Room Database**:
  - Uses **Room** for local storage of notes.
  - Provides a robust and structured way to handle SQLite database operations.

- **Kotlin Coroutines & Flow**:
  - Leveraged **Kotlin Coroutines** and **Flow** for asynchronous programming.
  - Ensures smooth and efficient data handling without blocking the main thread.

- **Navigation**:
  - Implements **Jetpack Navigation Compose** for seamless and type-safe navigation between screens.
  - Ensures a smooth user experience with well-defined navigation flows.

- **Material Design 3**:
  - Follows the latest **Material Design 3 (Material You)** principles for modern and intuitive UI.
  - Ensures visual consistency across Android devices.

- **Testable Codebase**:
  - The architecture and dependency injection make the app highly testable.
  - Supports writing unit and instrumentation tests for reliable functionality.
